Essentially a combination between a roguelike/bullet hell where you control the movement of bullets and units, like a kind of force.

The original idea for the game came after Nicoaranc played "Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order," where he shared with the rest of us his idea of stopping bullets. As we discussed it further, the concept described on the game's official page emerged

## First draw of the idea
